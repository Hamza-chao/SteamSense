# 🎮 SteamSense

**SteamSense** is a personalized game recommendation engine that uses your public **Steam** library and combines it with the **RAWG** game database to suggest new games you'll likely enjoy. The app leverages **NLP embeddings**, **cosine similarity**, and **Apache Spark** for data processing, all served through a simple **Streamlit UI**.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Steam Game Fetching**:  
   Enter your **SteamID64** to fetch your publicly owned games and playtime via Steam XML API.

2. **RAWG Game Data**:  
   Game data is fetched (or cached) from the RAWG API, including descriptions, genres, and ratings.

3. **Embeddings with Transformers**:  
   The app generates vector embeddings using `all-mpnet-base-v2` from **SentenceTransformers**, combining game description and genres.

4. **Recommendation Logic**:  
   - Filters owned games with more than 3 hours of playtime.
   - Matches owned games to RAWG dataset.
   - Computes a **user profile embedding** using weighted playtime.
   - Ranks games (not owned) based on **cosine similarity** and **RAWG rating**.
   - Recommends the top 10 high-rated similar games.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hamza-chao/SteamSense.git
cd SteamSense
```

### 2. Install requirements

```bash
pip install streamlit pyspark pandas numpy sentence-transformers scikit-learn requests
```

Or generate a `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### 3. Add your API key

Create a file named `config.py`:

```python
# config.py
RAWG_API_KEY = "your_rawg_api_key_here"
```

> 🔐 Your Steam profile **must be public** to fetch owned games.

### 4. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run recommender.py
```
